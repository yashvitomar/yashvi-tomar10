## 🚀 About Me

I’m a cross-platform mobile developer with 5+ years of experience building user-centric apps using React Native. I’ve delivered polished digital experiences across diverse industries — from luxury resorts and OTT platforms to eCommerce and mental wellness — always with a sharp focus on performance and usability.

My approach blends clean, scalable code with a strong eye for design. I specialize in crafting pixel-perfect UIs, optimizing app performance, and shipping smooth, bug-free experiences. Whether I’m leading feature development, collaborating closely with designers, or solving tough technical challenges, I bring creativity, precision, and reliability to every build.

I'm passionate about design systems, animations, and native integrations, and I stay up-to-date with the latest in mobile tech. At the core, I love turning complex ideas into simple, elegant products that people genuinely enjoy using.
